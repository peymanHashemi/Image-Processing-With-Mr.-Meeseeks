# Image-Processing-With-Mr.-Meeseeks
## Description
In this project, we assist Rick in addressing a peculiar problem with blue humanoid creatures known as Mr. Meeseeks. The goal is to apply several computer vision techniques using OpenCV to identify, separate, and process images of these creatures effectively. The project focuses on tasks such as color space conversion, object detection, color image reconstruction, edge detection, and histogram equalization.

## Project Objectives
### 1. Gray-scale Conversion:

Load a color image of Mr. Meeseeks (MeeseeksHQ).
Convert it to grayscale using OpenCVâ€™s cvtColor function.
Display both the original color image and the grayscale version in the report.

### 2. Object Detection and Isolation:

Load a color image of Mr. Meeseeks.
Develop a program to isolate Mr. Meeseeks from the rest of the environment based on their unique color.
Output an image where only Mr. Meeseeks is highlighted (e.g., by blacking out the rest of the image).

### 3. Color Image Reconstruction:

Use historical techniques inspired by early Russian engineers, where separate grayscale images for each color channel (Red, Green, Blue) were stacked to create a color image.
Implement a function to split an image into its three grayscale channels.
Write a second function to combine the three channels into a color image, ensuring correct channel order and alignment.
Address any blurriness caused by misalignment by developing an optimization function that minimizes alignment errors. Analyze the time complexity of your solution and suggest methods to improve efficiency.

### 4. Edge Detection:

Load an image (Edge) and apply the Canny edge detection algorithm using OpenCV.
Propose and implement a solution to eliminate unnecessary edges, such as those affecting wheat in the image. Provide a detailed explanation and analysis in the report.

### 5. Histogram Equalization on Color Images:

Explore methods for applying histogram equalization to color images.
Select a color image and implement your proposed solution.
Analyze the impact of this technique on the image and provide a detailed report with your findings.
